The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.

Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <i>antimagic field</i> in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an <i>antimagic field</i> because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)</p><p>A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. <i>Dispel magic</i> does not remove the field.</p><p>Two or more <i>antimagic fields</i> sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as <i>wall of force, prismatic sphere</i>, and <i>prismatic wall,</i> remain unaffected by <i>antimagic field</i> (see the individual spell descriptions).

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, <i>atonement</i> operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see <i>geas/quest</i>) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the <i>atonement</i> spell on its behalf.</p><p><i>Atonement</i> may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.</p><p><i>Reverse Magical Alignment Change:</i> If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, <i>atonement</i> returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.</p><p><i>Restore Class:</i> A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.</p><p><i>Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers:</i> A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking <i>atonement</i> from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.</p><p><i>Redemption or Temptation:</i> You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.</p><p>Though the spell description refers to evil acts, <i>atonement</i> can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Normally, changing alignment is up to the player.

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A <i>binding</i> spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.</p><p>You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <i>suggestion</i>, your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <i>dominate animal, dominate person,</i> or <i>dominate monster,</i> your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a <i>binding</i> spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the <i>binding</i> lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible.</p><p>Regardless of the version of <i>binding</i> you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.</p><p>If you are casting any of the first three versions of <i>binding</i> (those with limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding</i> spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the <i>binding</i> spells it has received are broken.</p><p>The <i>binding</i> spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.</p><p><i>Chaining:</i> The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>antipathy</i> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.</p><p><i>Slumber:</i> This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <i>slumbering</i>, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is more difficult to cast than <i>chaining</i>, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.</p><p><i>Bound Slumber:</i> This combination of <i>chaining</i> and <i>slumber</i> lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.</p><p><i>Hedged Prison:</i> The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.</p><p><i>Metamorphosis:</i> The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>metamorphosed</i>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p><p><i>Minimus Containment:</i> The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>contained</i>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p><p>You can't dispel a <i>binding</i> spell with <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar effect, though an <i>antimagic field</i> or <i>Mage's disjunction</i> affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to <i>dismissal, banishment,</i> or a similar effect.</p><p><i>Components:</i> The components for a <i>binding</i> spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of <i>binding</i> used. These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for <i>slumber</i> bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.</p><p>In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of <i>binding</i> (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.</p></description>\n",

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You \"blink\" back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.</p><p><i>Blinking</i> has several effects, as follows.</p><p>Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).</p><p>If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.</p><p>Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're <i>blinking</i> unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.</p><p>While <i>blinking</i>, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p><p>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.</p><p>While <i>blinking</i>, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)</p><p>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.</p><p>An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.</p><p>An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.</p><p>Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.</p></description>\n",

The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.

The spell has no effect on other creatures.</p><p><i>Raise Water:</i> This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the <i>lower water</i> version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.</p><p>With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A drop of water (for <i>raise water</i>) or a pinch of dust (for <i>lower water</i>).</p></description>\n",

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You can use <i>dispel magic</i> to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.</p><p><i>Note:</i> The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.</p><p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:</p><p><i>Targeted Dispel:</i> One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><i>Area Dispel:</i> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.</p><p>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the <i>dispel magic</i> spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.</p><p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p><p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</p><p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p><p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.</p><p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p><p><i>Counterspell:</i> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p></description>\n",

An <i>earthquake</i> cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.</p><p><i>Cliffs: Earthquake</i> causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>Open Ground:</i> Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down.

At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.</p><p><i>Structure:</i> Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>River, Lake, or Marsh:</i> Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p><p><i>Pinned beneath Rubble:</i> Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p></description>\n",

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Casting a <i>gate</i> spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.</p><p>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate.</i></p><p>The <i>gate</i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.</p><p>A <i>gate</i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate</i> from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.</p><p><i>Planar Travel:</i> As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell functions much like a <i>plane shift</i> spell, except that the <i>gate</i> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate</i> from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you - anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate</i> cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</p><p>You may hold the <i>gate</i> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.</p><p><i>Calling Creatures:</i> The second effect of the <i>gate</i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate,</i> although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</p><p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.</p><p>A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.</p><p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally</i> spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in \"livestock\" rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.</p><p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.</p><p><i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell such as <i>gate</i> to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</p><p><i>XP Cost:</i> 1,000 XP (only for the <i>calling creatures</i> function).</p></description>\n",

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A <i>glyph of warding</i> can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.</p><p>You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, <i>glyphs</i> can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. <i>Glyphs</i> can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. <i>Glyphs</i> respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple <i>glyphs</i> cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.</p><p>When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A <i>glyph</i> can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the <i>glyph</i> and tracery become nearly invisible.</p><p><i>Glyphs</i> cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. <i>Mislead</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>nondetection</i> (and similar magical effects) can fool a <i>glyph</i>, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. <i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>glyph of warding</i> with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the <i>glyph</i> does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the <i>glyph</i> (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>glyph of warding</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the <i>glyph</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>glyph of warding</i>.</p><p>Depending on the version selected, a <i>glyph</i> either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.</p><p><i>Blast Glyph:</i> A <i>blast glyph</i> deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.</p><p><i>Spell Glyph:</i> You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the <i>glyph.</i> If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the <i>glyph</i>.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> You trace the <i>glyph</i> with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp.</p></description>\n",

The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.</p><p><i>Fog:</i> Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</p><p><i>Arcane Locks:</i> All doors in the warded area are <i>arcane locked.</i> Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</p><p><i>Webs:</i> Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the <i>web</i> spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for <i>web</i>. Spell Resistance: No.</p><p><i>Confusion:</i> Where there are choices in direction - such as a corridor intersection or side passage - a minor <i>confusion-</i>type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: Yes.</p><p><i>Lost Doors:</i> One door per caster level is covered by a <i>silent image</i> to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: No.</p><p>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.</p><p>1. <i>Dancing lights</i> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</p><p>2. A <i>magic mouth</i> in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</p><p>3. A <i>stinking cloud</i> in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for <i>stinking cloud.</i> Spell Resistance: No.</p><p>4. A <i>gust of wind</i> in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.</p><p>5. A <i>suggestion</i> in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the <i>suggestion</i> mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.</p><p>The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A <i>dispel magic</i> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful <i>Mage's disjunction</i> destroys the entire <i>guards and wards</i> effect.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> Burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of blood.</p><p><i>Focus:</i> A small silver rod.</p></description>\n",

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>All creatures within the area gain the effects of a <i>protection from evil</i> spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.</p><p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against evil</i> can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding,</i> and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.</p><p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport,</i> and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle,</i> but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram - even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p><p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.</p></description>\n",

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <i>magic jar.</i> You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.</p><p>To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar</i> must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.</p><p>While in the <i>magic jar,</i> you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)</p><p>You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.</p><p>Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the <i>magic jar</i> unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar,</i> and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.</p><p>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar.</i> You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.</p><p>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar</i> if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.</p><p>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar,</i> if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p><p>If the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar,</i> you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar</i> returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the <i>magic jar</i> or at the host's location.</p><p><i>Focus:</i> A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp.</p></description>\n",

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical <i>darkness</i> or <i>invisibility</i> does. Silent movement or magical <i>silence</i> defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A <i>magic mouth</i> cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.</p><p>The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a <i>magic mouth</i> to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.</p><p><i>Magic mouth</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> A small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth 10 gp.</p></description>\n",

Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save.</p><p>Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered.

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).</p><p>You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.</p><p>The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p><p>A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.</p><p>A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.</p><p>At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).</p><p><i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p><p><i>XP Cost:</i> 100 XP.</p></description>\n",

The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.</p><p>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.</p><p>Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</p><p>When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p></description>\n",

However, any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall.</p><p>The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A <i>prismatic wall</i> spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.</p><p>Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.</p><p>The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A <i>rod of cancellation</i> or a <i>mage's disjunction</i> spell destroys a <i>prismatic wall</i>, but an <i>antimagic field</i> fails to penetrate it. <i>Dispel magic</i> and <i>greater dispel magic</i> cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it.

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.</p><p>First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.</p><p>Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a <i>magic jar</i> attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as <i>dominate person</i>). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the <i>protection from evil</i> effect. If the <i>protection from evil</i> effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.</p><p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.</p></description>\n",

First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.

The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.</p><p>In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.</p><p>Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).</p><p><i>Shadow walk</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.

One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.</p><p>If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it.

To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</p><p>A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).</p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p><p>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon</i> of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows.</p><p><i>Chaos:</i> Battleaxe</p><p><i>Evil:</i> Light flail</p><p><i>Good:</i> Warhammer</p><p><i>Law:</i> Longsword</p></description>\n",

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a <i>symbol of death</i> slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death</i> affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death</i> is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.</p><p>Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death</i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death</i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death</i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death</i> works normally.</p><p>As a default, a <i>symbol of death</i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p><p>In this case, \"reading\" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death</i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a <i>symbol of death</i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death</i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p><p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death</i> can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.</p><p>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect<i>.</i> Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p><p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death,</i> but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p><p><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol of death</i> with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the <i>symbol of death</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.</p><p>A <i>symbol of death</i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death.</i> Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death</i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.</p><p><i>Symbol of death</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>symbol of death</i> that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol of death</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a <i>symbol of death</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of death</i>.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp each.</p></description>\n",

A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p><p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.

No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p><p><i>Violent Thrust:</i> Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p><p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</p><p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p></description>\n",

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.</p><p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p><p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table.

When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</p><p><i>On Target:</i> You appear where you want to be.</p><p><i>Off Target:</i> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.

If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.</p><p><i>Mishap:</i> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \"scrambled.\" You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up.

The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC.

The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.</p><p>Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since <i>transmute rock to mud</i> can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.

The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.</p><p>Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.</p><p><i>Spell Completion:</i> First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.</p><p><i>Trigger Object:</i> The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A <i>sympathy</i> spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> Before the actual casting of <i>trap the soul,</i> you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)</p><p><i>Focus (Trigger Object Only):</i> If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as described above, is needed.</p></description>\n",

It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.</p><p>The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> A piece of string and a bit of wood.</p></description>\n",

       "<description type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A <i>wall of thorns</i> spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a <i>wall of thorns</i> takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)</p><p>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</p><p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.</p><p>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <i>wall of thorns</i> at normal speed without taking damage.</p><p>A <i>wall of thorns</i> can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.</p><p>Despite its appearance, a <i>wall of thorns</i> is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.</p></description>\n",

The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a <i>web</i> become entangled among the gluey fibers.

If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the <i>web</i> very slowly.
